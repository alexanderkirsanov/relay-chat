Make sure you have latest Nodejs (https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer and follow next steps:

1. Checkout the project `git clone https://github.com/alexanderkirsanov/relay-chat.git`
2. Open the directory `cd relay-chat`
3. Install all necessary dependencies by executing `npm i` command
4. Start application with `npm start`

Application will start on `http://localhost:3000/`. To change the port specify `PORT` env variable (3000 by default)

To run application in dev mode execute `npm run development`

To test application run `npm test`.

To automatically fix most of codestyle issues execute `npm run pretty`
